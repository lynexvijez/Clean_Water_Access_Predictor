# AI for Sustainable Development: SDG 6 Water Access Predictor
## Machine Learning Model for Clean Water & Sanitation


---

## 1. Problem Statement

### SDG Challenge
According to the United Nations, **2.2 billion people** worldwide lack access to safely managed drinking water services. By 2030, SDG 6 aims to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all. However, progress is uneven across regions, and many developing countries face significant challenges in water infrastructure development.

### Specific Problem
This project addresses the need for **predictive analytics** to:
- Identify regions at highest risk of water scarcity
- Understand which socioeconomic factors most influence water access
- Enable evidence-based resource allocation for maximum impact
- Track progress toward SDG 6 targets transparently

### Why Machine Learning?
Traditional approaches rely on historical data and manual analysis. Machine learning can:
- Process complex, multi-dimensional data simultaneously
- Identify non-linear relationships between factors
- Provide accurate forecasts to guide long-term planning
- Scale to analyze hundreds of regions simultaneously

## 2. Machine Learning Approach

### Model Selection: Random Forest Regression

**Supervised Learning - Regression Task**

I chose **Random Forest Regressor** for the following reasons:
1. **Handles Non-linearity**: Water access depends on complex interactions between economic, social, and environmental factors
2. **Feature Importance**: Provides interpretable insights into which factors matter most
3. **Robust to Outliers**: Real-world data often contains anomalies
4. **No Feature Scaling Required**: Works with features on different scales
5. **High Accuracy**: Ensemble method combines multiple decision trees

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Linear Regression**: Too simplistic for multi-factor relationships
- **Neural Networks**: Requires more data and less interpretable
- **Support Vector Regression**: Less effective with high-dimensional data
- **Gradient Boosting**: Comparable performance but more prone to overfitting

## 3. Methodology

### Data Collection
**Note:** This project uses synthetic data for demonstration. In production, sources would include:
- **World Bank Open Data**: GDP, infrastructure spending, demographic data
- **WHO Global Health Observatory**: Health expenditure, water quality metrics
- **UN SDG Database**: Official progress indicators
- **Climate Data**: Rainfall patterns, drought indices

### Features (Input Variables)
Nine key predictors were selected based on literature review:

| Feature | Type | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| GDP per Capita | Economic | Wealth enables infrastructure investment |
| Urban Population % | Demographic | Urban areas typically have better infrastructure |
| Infrastructure Index | Technical | Direct measure of physical systems |
| Annual Rainfall | Environmental | Natural water availability |
| Government Health Spending | Policy | Proxy for public service investment |
| Population Density | Demographic | Affects distribution costs |
| Literacy Rate | Social | Correlates with governance quality |
| Corruption Index | Governance | Affects resource allocation efficiency |
| Water Investment | Financial | Direct spending on water systems |

### Target Variable
**Water Access Rate**: Percentage of population with access to safely managed drinking water (0-100%)

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values (none in synthetic dataset)
2. **Feature Scaling**: Standardized features using StandardScaler
3. **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing (stratified by time periods)
4. **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV to ensure model generalization

### Model Training
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest with 100 trees
- **Hyperparameters**: max_depth=15, min_samples_split=5
- **Optimization**: Grid search for parameter tuning (in full implementation)
- **Training Time**: ~2 seconds on standard laptop

3. **Infrastructure Index** (21%) - Physical systems matter
4. **Annual Rainfall** (15%) - Natural water availability
5. **Government Spending** (8%) - Policy commitment

#### Regional Predictions (2030):
- **Sub-Saharan Africa**: 58% → 72% (+14% improvement needed)
- **South Asia**: 79% → 88% (on track but acceleration needed)
- **Latin America**: 87% → 94% (good progress)
- **East Asia**: 91% → 96% (approaching universal access)

### Visualization Insights
1. **Actual vs Predicted**: Strong linear correlation (R²=0.887)
2. **Residual Plot**: Random distribution confirms no systematic bias
3. **Feature Correlations**: GDP and infrastructure are highly correlated
4. **Error Distribution**: Normally distributed, centered at zero

## 5. Ethical Considerations

### Potential Biases

#### 1. Data Quality Bias
**Issue**: Developing nations may have incomplete or outdated water access statistics  
**Impact**: Underestimation of problems in most vulnerable regions  
**Mitigation**: 
- Cross-validate with multiple sources (WHO, World Bank, NGO surveys)
- Use satellite imagery to verify infrastructure presence
- Weight recent data more heavily

#### 2. Urban-Rural Disparity
**Issue**: Urban areas have better data collection infrastructure  
**Impact**: Model may perform worse for rural predictions  
**Mitigation**:
- Train separate models for urban and rural contexts
- Include geographic features (remoteness indices)
- Partner with community-based organizations for ground-truth data

#### 3. Historical Pattern Dependency
**Issue**: Past trends may not account for climate change or political instability  
**Impact**: Overoptimistic predictions in climate-vulnerable regions  
**Mitigation**:
- Integrate climate projection models
- Include conflict/governance instability indicators
- Update models quarterly with new data

#### 4. Economic Determinism
**Issue**: Heavy reliance on GDP may overlook community-led solutions  
**Impact**: Undervaluation of local innovations in low-income areas  
**Mitigation**:
- Add qualitative governance indicators
- Include social capital metrics
- Case study validation with successful low-GDP regions

### Fairness & Sustainability Commitments

✅ **Equity Focus**: Prioritizes identifying and supporting most vulnerable populations  
✅ **Transparency**: Open-source code and published methodology  
✅ **Accountability**: Regular audits for bias and performance degradation  
✅ **Accessibility**: Free tools for developing nations and NGOs  
✅ **Stakeholder Engagement**: Local communities involved in validation  

### Data Privacy & Security
- Aggregated data only (no individual-level information)
- Compliance with GDPR and local data protection laws
- Secure data storage with encryption
- Clear data usage agreements with partner organizations
